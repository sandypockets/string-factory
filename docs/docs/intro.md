# Welcome

Thanks for checking out `string-factory`! 

If you've never used `string-factory` before, then have a look at the [Getting started](introduction) section. It covers everything from adding the package to using it in a project. Otherwise, if you know what you're looking for, then take a look through the [Functions](functions) tab for full docs on everything.
