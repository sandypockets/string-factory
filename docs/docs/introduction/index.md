# Getting started
`string-factory` is a simple string manipulation library. Although it has plenty of day-to-day use cases, it was designed with automation in mind. 

Consider creating a new function for a library like this one. The function name, and docs page name use different casings for the same word. `string-factory` takes care of converting from one case to another, so you can focus on writing code that actually moves the needle.
